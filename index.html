<h1> INTRODUÇÃO </h1>

<p>Kaeya é um forte 4 estrelas free-to-play, um ótimo facilitador e sub dps. Ainda tendo um potencial como main DPS. Com sua baixa necessidade de Recarga de Energia e a consistente aplicação cryo, faz com que ele se torne um ótimo suporte para composições de Supercondução e de Vape/Melt. A habilidade de Burs té forte o suficiente para que ele se torne uma peça para composições de Reverse Melt, mesmo que não esteja em campo. Entretanto, seu verdadeiro potencial é apresentado em composições de permafreeze. Adicionado a um ChongHyun no time, sua força como um subdps e até mesmo main DPS cresce bastante. </p>

<h1> TALENTOS </h1><BR>
<H2>Ataque Normal</H2>
<h4><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="45" height="45" src="https://imgur.com/qVXqcsP.png"> Ceremonial Bladework</h4>



<p><em>Normal Attack: Performs up to 5 rapid strikes.</em><br><em>Charged Attack: Consumes a certain amount of Stamina to unleash 2 rapid sword strikes.</em></p>



<p>Kaeya’s AAs are perfectly adequate, but they are not the centerpiece of his kit. His NA multipliers are among the highest out of all current sword users, while his CA multipliers fall behind only Keqing and Jean’s, but his slower attacks mean he ends up more or less in the middle of the pack for Sword user MV/s. </p>



<p>Despite Kaeya’s slightly more even distribution of damage between Normals and Charged Attacks as compared to most other Sword users, his optimal attack strings all still include Charged Attacks. Without cancels, Kaeya’s highest damage attack string is N2C, followed by N1C and then N3C. With either jump or dash cancels, Kaeya’s N1C is his highest damage string, followed by N2C and then N3C. </p>



<p>However, N1C is Stamina-negative even with jump cancel only, while the other two will be closer to Stamina-neutral or positive in a vacuum. Stamina is much less of concern for Kaeya than for other Sword users, since he can abuse Freeze to reduce Stamina consumed from dodging and avoid enemy knockback, and his Utility Passive provides an additional boost to Stamina economy when dodging does become necessary or when using dash cancels, but it is still a factor nonetheless. Kaeya’s N4 and N5 are not generally recommended for optimal gameplay due to their long animations without the multipliers to justify them. <em>Most calculations for this guide assumed N2C attack strings for the sake of consistency, but players can use any practical combinations of N1-3C provided they can manage their Stamina consumption over the course of sustained combat.&nbsp;</em></p>

<H2> Habilidade Elemental</H2>
<h4><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="45" height="45" src="https://imgur.com/vkgUowP.png"> Frostgnaw</h4>



<p><em>Unleashes a frigid blast, dealing Cryo DMG to opponents in front of Kaeya.</em></p>



<p>A simple but useful tool. It produces a cone of Cryo damage in front of him with a hitbox which extends further in reach than his Burst can, but only targets forwards rather than all around the character. Strong Elemental application on a short cooldown makes it a powerful shield-breaking tool, especially against Electro and Hydro shields. Frostgnaw generates 2 to 3 Particles weighted to roughly a 2.67 average as a baseline, but can serve as a more powerful battery in conjunction with his 4th Ascension Talent discussed later.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<H2> Burst Elemental</H2>
<h4><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="45" height="45" src="https://imgur.com/I0oxxH4.png"> Glacial Waltz</h4>



<p><em>Coalescing the frost in the air, Kaeya summons 3 icicles that revolve 4 times around him for 8 seconds.</em></p>



<p><em>These icicles will follow the character around and deal Cryo DMG to opponents in their path for so long as they persist.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Kaeya’s Burst is the largest single source of damage and consistent Cryo application in his kit, on-field or off-field, single-target or AoE, from C0 to C6. At C0, it summons three icicles which revolve around him or the on-field character at a rate of one rotation every 2 seconds for 8 seconds, colliding with enemies in their path to deal Cryo damage, and ending with all icicles shattering for a final 3 hits, for a total of up to 15 instances of damage with a stationary character and enemy. The Burst snapshots character stats after cast, but before Energy drain.</p>



<p>The icicles have a hitbox just in front of their animated position, which means you need to be within about one Abyss tile of your target for his Burst to hit them. When an icicle hits an enemy, Glacial Waltz will deal an instance of AoE Cryo damage with a radius similar to that of the entire Burst but centered on the relevant icicle. That icicle will then be locked out of dealing damage for 0.5s, or 1/4 of a rotation. However, independent icicles have independent cooldowns. Thus, the clockwise movement of Glacial Waltz can be taken advantage of by the player moving counterclockwise around a single target to quickly hit the enemy with successive icicles, allowing players to fit in more instances of damage and Cryo application in the same time frame.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:28px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/dw3XdsIZCrv6W6DCgSRkoBPkjPcBMLv4CILXacvuZmlVKWlLqO5ms3moYorSvPZGaKxV-GmmFJvziaAdluxvGVNkPRgBTbI0pNun_AQhfHJMXDZuebqWS8R5DyV5GLqnRBChLf5G" width="617" height="347"></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Kaeya’s Burst hits the first hilichurl to the left, dealing AoE damage (blocked by their shields) and Cryo application that hits the two hilichurls to the left and the furthest left one behind him. The Burst is locked out from dealing damage until after it has passed the three hilichurls behind him, so the icicles move through them without triggering any additional instances of damage. Footage from jamberry#7142.</em></p>



<p>Kaeya’s Burst follows the standard 3-hit/2.5s rule for Internal Cooldown of Elemental application, for up to about one instance of Cryo application every 1.6s on average and a total of 6 instances throughout at C0 with a stationary on-field character and enemy. However, because the final 3 hits of his Burst occur simultaneously, in practice Cryo application occurs at a rate of just over once every 2s on average with an additional instance quickly following the previous at the end of the ability. Glacial Waltz’s ICD also places a limiting factor on Kaeya’s damage with Reverse Melt, as only up to 40% of his burst is meltable. As a Superconduct enabler or in Freeze, ICD of Cryo application is rarely a practical gameplay concern while Kaeya’s Burst is active; Cryo application is sufficient enough and managing number of hits past that is generally more of a damage concern.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<H2> Primeira Passiva de Ascenção</H2>

<h4><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="45" height="45" src="https://imgur.com/uAPqnWX.png"> Cold-Blooded Strike</h4>



<p><em>Every hit with Frostgnaw regenerates HP for Kaeya equal to 15% of his ATK.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>A sustain oriented Talent, but not a particularly strong one. A few hundred HP a couple times a rotation will rarely make or break your Abyss clear. That said, Freeze teams generally border on the edge of being able to run without a healer or shielder depending on player skill and game content, so any additional survivability is a welcome bonus and a nudge in the direction of more damage-oriented teams for Kaeya.&nbsp;</p>

<H2> Quarta Passiva de Ascenção</H2>

<h4><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="45" height="45" src="https://imgur.com/q9FM12L.png"> Glacial Heart</h4>



<p><em>Opponents Frozen by Frostgnaw will drop additional Elemental Particles. Frostgnaw may only produce a maximum of 2 additional Elemental Particles per use.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Kaeya’s A4 unlocks his potential as conditionally the strongest battery in the game, second only to an on-field Bennett. The description is incorrect; Frostgnaw can produce up to 2 additional Particles by either Freezing enemies or hitting already Frozen enemies. This allows main DPS Kaeya’s team members to run slightly under on ER requirements, and allows him to battery other Cryo units with ease provided a Hydro applier on the same team without having to settle for options that would limit his personal damage like Favonius or Sacrificial weapons while still having the option to run them for even more battery power if desired.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XPE2eFNFS59pKttsK3qgBzFvU7J3VVKiDK1eM8pQAKr3Syn2JLSxeIOPhBwqid6RiC0EQjLhc8Wf0e35f3gSxtBaZg-NHZQOgbF-oNFav1UroE-gasYFmS0JJ0uYGPm4ceDwSxTx" width="623" height="350"></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Kaeya equipped with a Favonius Sword uses his skill to Freeze a group of slimes, generating 5 Cryo Particles from his Skill, three neutral Particles from Favonius Sword’s passive, and additional Hydro Particles from Hydro slime HP thresholds, filling a majority of Ganyu’s Energy meter with one ability. Footage from EdisonsMathsClub#6469.&nbsp;</em></p>

<H2> Passiva de Utilidade</H2>

<h4> <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="45" height="45" src="https://imgur.com/ZsMpesx.png"> Hidden Strength</h4>



<p><em>Decreases sprinting Stamina consumption of your characters in the party by 20%.</em><br><em>Not stackable with Passive Talents that provide the exact same effects.</em></p>



<p>Shared with Razor and now Kazuha, Stamina reduction on sprint is one of the only Utility Passives actually useful in combat. Valuable to everyone, but especially to Stamina-hungry Charged Attack focused DPSes, including to some degree Kaeya himself.&nbsp;</p>
